<h2>Lavash is the variation of Tukey's famous dish - kebab.</h2>
<p>Lavash has almost similar structure to Turkish kebab, 
    but its own unique sauce that is available only in Uzbekistan.
</p>
<p>There are many ways to cook lavash, 
    but my favorite one is to use as 
    much sauce as possible.</p>
<p>First, prepare your spit and mean. When meat is cooked, put in on 
    a nice slice of lavash. Don't forget to add some vegetables and sauce.
    Finally, wrap it up and eat!
