<h2>This is one of the many varieties of Mac and Cheese</h2>
<p>If you can make boxed macaroni and cheese, you can make this one-pan, 
    scratch-made mac and cheese! The bacon, chives, and crispy bread crumb topping add some great extra flavor and texture.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>16 ounces of uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
    <li>2 half cups of milk</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of margarine</li>
    <li>1 half cups shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    <li>1/4 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
    <li>1/4 cup real bacon bits</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon snipped chives</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, 
        and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over 
        medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring 
        occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, 
        stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, 
        until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been 
        absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper 
        until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the 
        Parmesan cheese until melted.</li>
    <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source 
        and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
    <li>Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of 
        Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.</li>
    <li>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is 
        lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with 
        chives and serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
